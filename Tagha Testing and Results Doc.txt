test_3d_vecs.tbc - purpose: test float and pointer/array arithmetics.
	accurate result:
		register[1] == 3221225472 <-- -2.f
		register[2] == 3225419776 <-- -3.f
		register[3] == 3229614080 <-- -4.f

test_factorial.tbc - purpose: test stack and recursive call frames.
	accurate result:
		register[0] == 120 <--
		factorial result == 120 <--

test_native.tbc - purpose: calling a native and testing a host app-side variable being modified by the script.
	accurate result:
		player.speed: '300.000000' | player.health: '100' | player.ammo: '32'

test_stdin.tbc - purpose: advanced test combo of calling natives, passing host exported global pointers to natives, and loading string literals from script memory.
	accurate result:
		Please enter a long string:  <--
		*long pause because you're supposed to type stuff and hit enter.*
		...
		register[14] == 163399954 <-- address of buffer array. (random number because ptr)
		register[15] == 256 <-- size of buffer array.
		register[16] == 3077363104 <-- ptr value of 'stdin'. (random number because ptr)
