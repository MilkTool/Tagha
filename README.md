# Tagha Virtual Machine
A minimal but complex register-based virtual machine && runtime environment, built in C, designed to run C. Because C is king.

Why? (See the Wiki for the full explanations)
Three reasons:
* 1. In my opinion, there are no good, self-contained C interpreters.
* 2. I wanted to learn how to make a virtual machine.
* 3. Allow C to be portable at the binary level.
* 4. Create a minimal and easy to use library for use in other software.
